 The app I made was meant to help people track their weight lost journey.  The goal was to make something simple that people could use to keep track of their progress.  It was meant to be easy and useful for everyone who used it.

 Someone could log in, there's a main screen with the most important information, and there's another screen where people could add or change items.  If users wanted alerts, they could also choose to allow SMS access.  My goal was for everything to be clear and simple to use. The layouts and buttons should all make sense.  That's what I tried to think of that would help someone use the app without getting lost.

 I built the app in Android Studio and made sure to separate things into smaller pieces to keep things in order.  Git's version control let me go back and fix things if I messed up.  I made sure to write clean code and give things clear names so that they were easy to find and fix.  These habits will help me with projects in the future for sure.

 I used both the emulator in Android Studio and a live phone to test the app.  Making sure the app worked even when I put in wrong information or left things blank was something I did.  It was very important to test the app because it helped me find bugs and improve it.


 It was hard to get the screen to change right away when new information was added.  I found a way to fix it by researching and learning how to use tools that help the screen restart itself.  It was cool to figure out, even though it took a while.

 I'm most pleased with how it looks and how simple it is to use.  I really like how the form where people put their information turned out.  It looks good, works well, and shows that I know how to make things that work and are easy for people to use.
